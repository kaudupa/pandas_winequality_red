# pandas_winequality_red
Analysing quality of  red wine using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn
Analysing winequality-red.csv using pandas, numpy and seaborn heatmap. 
There are number of factors like acids, ph, alcohol content etc which affect the quality of wine. 
Here we are going to find which factor affect quality of wine. and which are all the acids going to affect the ph of wine with numpy and heatmap. 
Winequality-red.csv: this dataset related to redwine with below columns. 
fixed acid-Acid involved with wine. 
Volatile acid- acetic acid added to wine. 
citric acid- as name mentioned. 
residual sugar- amount of sugar added to wine. 
chlorides- amount of salt added to wine. 
free sulphur dioxide-the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine 
total sulfur dioxide- amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine. 
density- the density of water depending on alcohol and sugar content. 
pH- describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale. 
sulphates-a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant. alcohol-alcohol content in wine. 
quality-output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10).
